Share your Pokemon Go Scanner data the easy way!

This Telegram chatbot will message you and others on mobile devices as soon as your scanner finds a pokemon.

No port forwarding needed, no ngrok _too many connections_, no clunky web browser handling on mobile.


Use it for yourself, share it with your friends or whole neighborhood. No additional app required for receiving messages.
The more scanners the bot is linked with, the better it becomes.



## Features
* Receive a message for spotted Pokemon including street name, how far away it is, time to get there (by bike or foot), time till it disappears
* Request a map of Pokemons position
* Add pokemon to your filter to disable notifications
* Set a distance limit and don't be notified of pokemon out of your reach
* Set a language for Pokemon's names. Including English, German, French, Japanese
* and more  

_Configuring the bot affects only the user himself. All settings are personalized and don't change the bot's behaviour for other users._
