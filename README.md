Share your Pokemon Go Scanner data the easy way!

This Telegram chatbot will message you and others on mobile devices as soon as your scanner finds a pokemon.

No port forwarding needed, no ngrok _too many connections_, no clunky web browser handling on mobile.


Use it for yourself, share it with your friends or whole neighborhood. No additional app required for receiving messages.
The more scanners the bot is linked with, the better it becomes.

* Request a map of Pokemons position
* Add pokemon to your filter and don't get notifications for them
* Set a distance limit and don't be notified of pokemon out of your reach
* Set a language for Pokemon's names. Including English, German, French, Japanese
* and more
